<p>Greatest Ending of a Movie Saga. Has amazing callbacks, great dialogue, and memorable moments. The MCU could have ended there imo</p>
<br />

<h2>Mulan</h2>

<p>My favorite Disney movie of all time. Great coming of age story, strong female lead w/o being blantant about her gender and amazing music. Easy rewatch anytime.</p>
<br />

<h2>Top Gun: Maverick</h2>

<p>Same for Endgame in a way. Has great callback to the original but amazing stunt work that is unparralled</p>
<br />

<h2>Gone Girl</h2>
